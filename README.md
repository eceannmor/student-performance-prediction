# Tutor4_s28021
A simple data science project, centred around a student performance dataset.<br/>
The goal is to analyse current conditions of students, and use the dataset together with ML models to predict which students might benefit from additional help or a change of environment.<br/>
This is a *practice project* in preparation to a diploma thesis, on the same topic, which will include a larger database and more complex analysis.

This project currently includes:
* Data import and standardisation scripts
* Data analysis using:
    * Multiple linear regression
    * ~~Least-angle regression~~
    * ~~Multinominal logical regression~~
    * ~~Robust regression~~ 

You will need the latest release of [Java](https://www.java.com/download), [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), as well as a local ~~or remote~~ [PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/). The drivers for proper database communication and the sample data are already included.

## Usage
* Clone this repository
    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/PROJ-D-2024/Tutor3_s28021.git
    cd Tutor3_s28021
    ```
* Run a [PostgreSQL database instance](https://www.postgresql.org/) to use as the final storage for the data. 

  > :warning: Currently only **non-containerised**, **localhost** PostgreSQL databases are supported.<br/>
  `TODO`: replace server side `COPY` with client side `\copy`.
* Copy `sample_config` as `database.cfg` into `/src`:
    * Windows: `copy sample_config.cfg ./PRO1D/scr/database.cfg -a`
    * Linux: `cp sample_config.cfg ./PRO1D/src/database.cfg`

    and fill out the database connection info and credentials in this format:
    ```properties
    dbname=<database name>
    hostname=<hostname>
    port=<port>
    username=<username>
    password=<password>
    ```
* Execute the `run.sh` script:
    * Windows: `./run.sh`
    * Linux: `sudo bash run.sh`
